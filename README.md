# Oh-my-stack

## About
Oh-My-Stack is a repository for a set of methods that can be used with a Stack data structure.

## Why is that ?

Stack usually works with pop and push only , following LIFO , so i though of adding new algorithms that can be used to solve problems while dealing with a stack data structure like :

1.pop() 
2.push() - updated : to push an item to the top of the stack while verifying if the item already exists.
3.isEmpty() : to check if a stack is empty.
4.clear() : to clear a stack.
5.peek() : to check the top item of a stack.

## Contribution 

Any contribution is welcomed.
